# 8input-xor-mcpit-ANN
Hi There! This is the python code for an 8 input XOR Logic Gate that is implemented into a Neural Network. The neural network in question is the McPitt Artificial Neural Network , which was one of the first Neural Networks ever created. I am using python here and the environment for it is Jupyter Notebook.
This here is an illustration for an 8 input XOR Model.
